<p>In an effort to gain more direct knowledge about cyber operations, which seems like a good idea due to the fact that I work on cyber services used in Federal stakeholder operations, and out of genuine interest, I have begun implementing a security operations center (SOC) on my home network! The key piece of hardware is Pico Cluster 5T. The new Raspberry Pis aren't like those from past generations - they are quite powerful, and the head node will have a beefy 16GB of RAM allowing it to run a lightweight SIEM and process logs. Once I have it up and running, I'll post about the specific software implementation</p>

<p>It took a little thought and many conversations with AI to get a feel for how it should work. In a nutshell, it uses an inline architecture, port mirroring with the cluster on a separate VLAN, and will basically look like this:</p>

<p>
[Internet]───[Main Gateway/WiFi Router]───[Other LAN Devices]
                    |
                    └──[Managed Switch}───[PicoCluster Router]──[Pi Nodes 1-5]
</p>

<p>The goal here is the for the SOC to have maximum visibility into network traffic without over-taxing the resources. I can do a few low-risk tests and simulate various attacks and see how these are logged and presented in dashboards and alerts. I'll keep experiments with malware in a VM sandbox on my PC for now, or I may reconfigure the SOC and use it as its own sandbox while situating it in a more segmented way on my network.</p>

<p>Another fun project I'm pushing to later in the summer is building an AI chatbot from scratch (leveraging all those good notes from my Computational Linguistics class at UB a few years ago), in which I will train a basic model on the writing of Hazrat Inayat Khan, a Sufi mystic from the early 20th century who brought a more liberal, universalist brand of Sufism to the West from India. His writings, at this point, are public domain, and I am in the process of gathering his writings and con verting them to cleaned up text and then into tokens while verifying the legality of using long-established translations in this way.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I take my PMP exam in a few days! I've (over)prepared for a few months and look forward to getting it out of the way so I can focus on the CompTia CySA+ exam before gearing up for my CISSP in 2026.</p>

<p>It should be a very busy summer with these personal projects, work, fitness/gym stuff, and some personal travel with the wife that we're both looking forward to!</p>

<p>More to come! Have a great summer!</p>

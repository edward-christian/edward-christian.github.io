<p>Hello world! This is my first post on my Github pages site using Jekyll's "Chirpy" theme. Getting a custom domain in place and customizing the site code a bit was easier than I expected! This came after a few hours of struggling to get a Blogger site to look how I wanted. What a horrid platform! Glad I found this, and it's serendipitous because I plan to use Github on some homelab projects, all of which I will detail here. I have a couple configurations in mind, both hardware and virtualized. I'll try to make the content fun and unique.</p>

<p>Until next time!!</p>
